    <h2>How to Make Honey cake</h2>
    <p>
      This honey cake can be made in three different ways: the hard way, the
      harder way, and how we're going to do it — the hardest way... Because it's
      that worth it. The secret to this cake's fantastic flavor is the tiny
      amount of bitterness from burnt honey. The slightly tangy whipped cream
      frosting provides a bit of acidity and lovely light texture, and unlike
      other frostings, it's not too sweet.

    <h2>How to Make honey cake Step-By-Step:</h2>
    <p>Directions</p>

    <ol>
      <li>
        Pour 3/4 cup wildflower honey into a deep saucepan over medium heat.
        Boil until a shade darker and caramel-like in aroma, about 10 minutes.
        Turn off heat and whisk in cold water.
      </li>
      <li>
        Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Line a baking sheet
        with a silicone baking mat. Place a mixing bowl and whisk in the
        refrigerator.
      </li>
      <li>
        Place a large metal bowl over the lowest heat setting on the stovetop.
        Add sugar, butter, 3/4 cup wildflower honey, and 1/4 cup burnt honey.
        Let sit until butter melts, 5 to 7 minutes. Reserve remaining burnt
        honey for the frosting.
      </li>
      <li>
        Meanwhile, combine baking soda, cinnamon, and salt in a small bowl.
      </li>
      <li>
        Whisk butter mixture and let sit until very warm to the touch. Whisk in
        eggs. Keep mixture over low heat until it warms up again, then whisk in
        baking soda mixture. Remove from heat. Sift in flour in 2 or 3
        additions, stirring well after each, until batter is easily spreadable.
